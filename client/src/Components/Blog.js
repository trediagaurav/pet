              Every once in a while, you might come home from an especially
              hellish day of trying and failing to accomplish the bare minimum,
              only to be faced with an empty, silent apartment. Sure, pets might
              not solve the big problems in your life, but they can definitely
              help with that lonely, icky feeling of a lingering bad day.

              The vast expanse of the bathtub is unsettling to some small dogs.
              Avoid giving your tiny dog an existential crisis by using a sink
              instead. He'll feel more contained and secure, and you'll be
              physically closer to him the entire time.

              Pets, in general, are a manâ€™s best friend, but many pet owners
              inevitably want to get themselves another pet at some time or
              another. But with so much care and attention that you have to give
              your animal friends, it can be a bit tricky to choose whether or
              not you should get a pet and what animal you should get.
